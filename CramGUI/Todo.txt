High Priority
=============
* Allow for "base path" (-ipath, -ppath)
* Run from settings file

Lower Priority
==============
* More automated sanity checks
	(check that all rects are accounted for, no duplicate IDs, no overlaps, none outside image, etc.)
* Delete existing pages (-clean)
* "Quiet" mode
* More careful handling of error conditions for core code

Done
====
* Settings save/restore
* Polished API
* Commandline interface
* Extra tight packing
* Fallback sizes for last page (code+GUI)
* Borders
* Enhanced sanity checking & assertions to catch problems early on
