High Priority
=============

Lower Priority
==============
* More automated sanity checks
	(check that all rects are accounted for, no duplicate IDs, no overlaps, none outside image, etc.)
* "Quiet" mode(?)

Done
====
* Warn if two images end up with the same "final name"
* Nailed down error result, so we should always give an error code on shell
  if something "incredibly bad" happens (e.g. output files not being written)
* Delete existing pages (-clean)
* Use settings file on commandline
* Allow for "base path" (-ipath)
* Settings save/restore
* Polished API
* Commandline interface
* Extra tight packing
* Fallback sizes for last page (code+GUI)
* Borders
* Enhanced sanity checking & assertions to catch problems early on
